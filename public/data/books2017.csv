How to survive a plague - David France **,Story of the early days of the AIDS epidemic and ACT UP. Clearly from one man’s viewpoint.,2
Wolf Hall - Hillary Mantel **,Soapy retelling of Cromwell and More and Anne Boleyn and whatnot.,2
Central Station - Lavie Tidhar **,Cyberpunkish novel set in future Tel Aviv. Riffs on giant Tel Aviv bus station as the main way people get on and off world.,2
The Buried Giant - Kazuo Ishiguro -,"Ugh. Mannered and pointless. I might have gotten something more out of it if I were more familiar with Arthurian legend, but who the hell cares?",-1
Reputations - Juan Gabriel Vasquez *,About fame and memory and reputation and regret. Nicely written even in translation. Not that interested in the story.,1
Underground Airlines - Ben Winter ***,Alternate history where slavery’s still legal in four states in the present day.,3
The impossible lives of Greta Wells - Andrew Sean Greer**,Woman bounces between three timelines where she lives at different times.,2
Becoming Jane Jacobs - Peter Laurence**,"Bio of Jane Jacobs (obvs) through writing Death and Life. Good about situating her ideas in the context of contemporary thought about architecture and city planning. Needs editing, though.",2
Bring out the Bodies - Hillary Mantel **,Sequel to Wolf Hall.,2
Wall of Storms - Ken Liu *,"Sequel to Grace of Kings. Overly long, busily-plotted.",1
Arkwright - Allan Steele *,"Self-consciously old-fashioned space colonization novel. Skips from generation to generation in one family. Mostly meh and not well written. Last part could be interesting, but has way too much infodump.",1
Sea of Poppies - Amitav Gosh **,A bit labyrinthine and melodramatic story of opium war era India. First in a trilogy.,2
Judenstaat - Suzanne Zeltich **,"Alt history where Jewish state set up in Germany. Interesting concept. Questionable characters, plot.",2
Heroine Complex - Sarah Kuhn **,"Cute, kinda dumb, but very fun. Asian superheroes in SF.",2
Roses and Rot - Kat Howard ***,Nicely twisted modern faerie tale. Two artist sisters. Disappointing ending.,3
Wake of Vultures - Lila Bowen **,Pretty high quality Weird Western.,2
Binti - Nnedi Okorafor **,Short but good YA,2
Tangled Web - Michael Zalewski *,Dated but apparently the standard security resource for web applications. I was surprised that it focused almost entirely on client-side stuff.,1
Hag-seed - Margaret Atwood **,Tempest staged in prison.,2
Breath of Earth - Beth Cato **,Relatively well done steampunk with geomancy. US and Japan are allies.,2
Four Futures - Peter Frase **,Explores how four futures could turn out.,2
Corsair - James L. Cambias **,Sort of A Techno Thriller. Trashy but not entirely stupid.,2
Obelisk Gate - N K Jemesin ***,Very good considering it's the middle book of a trilogy. Post apocalyptic. Some people are geomancers.,3
Archangel - Marguerite Reed ***,"Good SF, nicely drawn planetary society. Mildly predictable plot. Woman runs hunts on limited-immigration world.",3
Mislaid - Nell Zink **,"Melodramatic story of split up family where mother takes daughter, dad takes son.",2
The core of the sun - Johanna Sinisalo***,Dystopic Finland where caffeine alcohol and chile peppers are banned and women are bred to be submissive.,3
How everything became war and the military became everything - Rosa Brooks **,"Tale of how the military became so important in us politics/diplomacy/foreign policy. Genuinely critical of the military overreach but misses several points and shows the author’s blind spots in several areas: 1. Cites plight of Palestinians as an example of why the us military should be able to intervene (!). Thinks about terrorism as only foreign terrorism (""only on 9/11 has terrorism killed more people than lightning""). If you consider terrorism legit reason for expanded military role, what about domestic terrorism? Also talks about coup in Chile without addressing US role in it. Theses: 1. There's not gonna be a return to a bright line between war and peace so we should figure out how to exist in the gray area. 2. It's unlikely in the extreme that we'll ever return to a situation where the civilian sector is well-funded enough to do the things it used to do that the military does now.",2
Caliban's war - James S. A. Corey (reread) **,#2 in the Expanse.,2
The Sellout - Paul Beatty ***,"Black farmer in South LA. Satirical and pointed, but possibly too much so for me.",3
Empire Games - Charlie Stross **,Latest in parallel worlds universe. Competent and entertaining. Interesting speculation (becoming decreasingly speculative) about security state.,2
Star fraction - Ken Macleod (reread) **,"First in Fall Revolution series. I love the literate reading of the interplay between Left(ish) factions here. Also, funny.",2
Abbadon’s Gate - James S A Corey (reread) **,Expanse #3. Feel like things start to go off the rails a little here.,2
Katrina - Gary Rivlin **,Aftermath and reconstruction of New Orleans after Katrina. Plenty of blame to go around.,2
Stone Canal - Ken Macleod (reread) **,Second in Fall Revolution. Not as good as #1.,2

Cibola Burn - James S. A. Corey (reread) **,Expanse #4. Stranded on an alien planet.,2
Sky Road - Ken Macleod (reread) *,"Fall Revolution #4. Shtick is getting a little old by now. Note that his Parallel storylines from near-future Earth and far-future elsewhere technique is used in I think three of these books, but to more success in Cosmonaut Keep.",1
Nemesis games - James S.A. Corey (reread) **,Expanse #5.,2
"Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs and One Quest for Transcendent Software - Scott Rosenberg **",Story of Mitch Kapor trying to make software interwoven with general discussion of software practice.,2
Babylon’s Ashes - James S.A. Corey **,Expanse 6. Ending was way too Deus Ex Machina,2
Seven Surrenders - Ada Palmer **,"Sequel to Too Like the Lightning. Not as good, although I think I might have liked it much better were the previous one fresher in my mind.",2
The Night Ocean - Paul La Farge ***,Lovecraft’s circle. Does a lot of destabilizing the narrative. Finally the storytelling’s catching up to the writing,3
New York 2140 - Kim Stanley Robinson ***,Post sea level rise New York. Classic KSR (which of course I love).,3
The Ecliptic - Benjamin Wood **,Artists at a retreat in Turkey. Painter has traumatic experience on ocean liner.,2
Bloodline Feud - Charlie Stross (reread) **,"First (two, bundled) in Merchant saga. Much of these books reads like an excuse to talk about economics. Entertainingly-written, though.",2
Clan Corporate - Charles Stross (reread) **,#3 in the Merchant Princes saga.,2
Unidentified Funny Objects - Alex Schwartzman (ed) *,Short stories. Some are funny.,1
After Atlas - Emma Newman **,Perfectly competent SF mystery with bigger picture. Only disappointing cause Planetfall was so good.,2
"Anthropocene or Capitalocene?:Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism - Jason Moore (ed) **",Uneven collection of essays on capitalism and climate change and the impact of how we consider it.,2
Revolution Trade - Charles Stross **,5 and 6 in the Merchant Princes thing. Apocalypse! I accidentally skipped #4 and am no worse for it.,2
Luna: Wolf Moon - Ian MacDonald **,Second in Luna series. Starts a little rough (not least ‘cause I didn’t remember all the people) but finishes strong.,2
Conspiracy of Ravens - Lila Bowen **,Sequel to Wake of Vultures. Weird Western. Transgender main character.,2
Beyond the Gates - Catherine Wells. **,Pseudo-Muslim world with unknown continent,2
Waking Gods - Sylvain Neuvel ***,Somehow the hodgepodge interview format still works. Sequel to Sleeping Giants.,3
Convergence- CJ Cherryh **,Latest in Foreigner series.,2
Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War - Fred Kaplan *,"History of NSA maneuvering is more like it. Some real howlers in here, like saying Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by “anarchists”.",1
City of Miracles - Robert Jackson Bennett **,Sequel to City of Stairs and city of Blades. Not as good as either. Got that Deus ex Deus thing that gods in fantasy books often invoke.,2
"Best American Sports Writing 2016 - Rick Telander, ed *",I’ve read much better editions of this.,1
Radical Candor - Kim Scott ***,Be genuinely caring and genuinely honest. Pretty good for a biz book.,3
A Closed and Common Orbit - Becky Chambers **,Embodied android from previous book and scavenger girl. Better than the last one. Sequel to The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet.,2
Walkaway - Cory Doctorow **,"Reads somewhat like a manifesto. Which I’m ok with, since I think the ideas are interesting. Definitely in dialog with his earlier self (whuffie from Down and Out, particularly)",2
Abyss Beyond Dreams - Peter Hamilton *,Too long! Area called The Void where telepathy and telekinesis works. Guy from earth comes to change stuff.,1
Super Extra Grande - Yoss **,Cuban. Veterinarian to truly giant animals. Would be hard if you knew zero Spanish I bet. Mildly humorous.,2
Killing Gravity - Corey White **,Loner who has mind powers developed by the military meets up with crew who support her quest for revenge.,2
Execution Channel - Ken Macleod **,Mildly confusing Britain v Europe v Russia v US spy story.,2
Ninefox Gambit- Yoon Ha Lee***,Reread (see 2016),3
Raven Stratagem - Yoon Ha Lee***,"Sequel to Ninefox Gambit. Still great, although not the headkick the first one was",3
A Paradise Built in Hell - Rebecca Solnit ***,"Disasters are often followed by stepping up of ordinary people and elite panic. Communities can respond, but institutions generally cannot. In fact, elites tend to panic, and crack down in unhelpful ways (e.g. shooting looters)",3
Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley - Antonio Garcia Martinez *,"Book-length self-justification by a repulsive human being. Gives brogrammers a bad name. Not entirely without interest or insight about Silicon Valley, but overall more value as a primary source of how terrible the tech industry is than as an observation of it.",1
The Soul of a New Machine - Paul Tracy Kidder **,Story of a new 32-bit minicomputer and the drama around it. Notable largely as an early effort to describe how computers work in context of the story.,2
A Fine Mess - T R Reid **,Taxes and how to make them better. Very much a believer in the Broad Base Low Rates idea. Not entirely convincing about every example.,2
On Tyranny - Timothy Snyder ***,Rules to live by to resist tyranny. Short and sweet.,3

The Boy on the Bridge - M. R. Carey**,Sequel of sorts to The Girl With All the Gifts. Not as good.,2
House of Shattered Wings - Aliette de Bodard **,"Post-magical apocalypse Paris. Fallen. Houses. Morningstar, asmodeus.",2
Kangaroo Too - Curtis Chen **,"Sequel to Waypoint Kangaroo. Still silly, but entertaining.",2
Move Fast and Break Things - Jonathan Taplin **,"Intermittently compelling take on the pernicious effects of the internet. Lost me in 1) his carping about the internet lowering culture and 2) his assault on Fair Use. Also some of his line drawing between libertarian ideology and specific actions of internet companies was pretty weak. Also, uses “anarchist” as an all-purpose epithet.",2
Tropic of Kansas - Christopher Brown **,"Post descent into fascism America. Concentrates on resistance. Petty great for the first two thirds, then feels super rushed.",2
The Heart of the Mission - Cary Cordova **,Fascinating history of the (Latino) arts movements in the Mission up to the 80s. I was mildly frustrated that it ended just around the time I showed up!,2
Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest - Zeynep Tufekci ***,"Strengths and weaknesses of network-driven protests. Posits three dimensions of capacity: Narrative, Disruptive and Institutional/electoral. Occupy, e.g., has much of the first, some of the second and very little of the third. Also, posits that social media organized protestsd can grow very quickly but don't have the capaicty ot make decisions on the ground and have not built the structure to react to events, since they haven't worked together.",3
The Stars are Legion - Kameron Hurley *,Weird split of space opera with journey through a fantastic series of confusingly-drawn levels. Unconvincing characters.,1
Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. - Neal Stephenson & Nocole Galland **,"Pefectly fine time-travel book. Some funny bureaucratic moments, but missing the usual Stephenson voice.",2
"Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's War, 1941-1945 - Leo Marks **",Insufficiently edited but perfectly entertaining first-person account of WWII cryptography,2
Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism - L. A. Kauffman **,History of Direct Action from 1971 Mayday to Fergusen. Sees tension primarily in centralized/decentralized axis. ,2
No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need - Naomi Klein **,"Outlines the reasons for Trump's success and that we need to fight *FOR* stuff, not just against bad things.",2
Sourdough - Robin Sloan **,Cute! Woman working at robotics startup has magic sourdough starter.,2
Economism - James Kwak ***,"Economism is the ideology that Econ 101 explains the world and that anything one does to try to, say, improve equality is necessarily counterproductive. Not coincidentally, this benefits rich people. Examples includ  the effects of taxes on rich people (no evidence they work less when taxes go up) and health care (where higher deductibles don't make better consumers). ",3
After On: A Novel of Silicon Valley - Rob Reid **,AI and silicon valley. Needed an editor and about 100 fewer pages. Also some more developed female characters,2
The Corporation Wars: Dissidence - Ken MacLeod **,"Slow to start. Trademark MacLeod political organization. First in trilogy, and shows it",2
The Half-Drowned King - Linnea Hartsuyker **,Historical novel about vikings.,2
Defining Moments in Black History - Dick Gregory *,"Anecdotes, conspiracies, and occasional insights.",1
